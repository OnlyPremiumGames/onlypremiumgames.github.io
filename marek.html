        <h3>Profile</h3>
        <p>
            I’m a software developer, systems engineer and agile methodologies enthusiast with more than 18 years of
            project
            experience with developing software for medical devices. Throughout the years I worked on multiple projects
            within the
            medical ultrasound domain. My preferred programming language is C#, I also have experience with C++. As my
            career
            progressed, my focus started shifting from coding towards having more responsibility as a team’s scrum
            master and later
            as a product owner. This role was later complemented with people management responsibilities. After a few
            years, I took
            a break from leadership roles and gained vast experience with systems engineering. My latest role was
            combination of
            team leader, product owner and clinical collaboration representative. I spent my whole career in a very
            agile-centric
            environment which transformed from pure Scrum, to incorporating KANBAN and later SAFe.<br>
            I consider myself as a person with multi-tasking, leadership, and organisational skills. I have strong
            analytical and
            problem-solving skills and I’m always looking for new knowledge. Good communication and interpersonal skills
            and the
            ability to work independently as well as part of a team are my strengths. I’m familiar with a various
            software
            development tools, quality management tasks, product builds and continuous integration, code reviews.<br>
            My personal interests include my family (married, two sons), sports (basketball, badminton, MTB), video
            games (playing,
            designing and creation) and books.

                ultrasound

            <dd>Roles: <b>Team Leader, Software Developer, Ultrasound Engineer, Product Owner, Clinical Collaboration
                    Representative</b></dd>
            <dd>Responsibilities: I was leading and coordinating three international development teams - one software
                team, one team focusing on low level rendering improvements and a team of ultrasound engineers. As their
                product owner
                my main responsibility was to collect and analyse requirements from various stakeholders and based on
                that
                prioritise team
                backlogs and plan accordingly. As a person with software development background I provided support for
                the SW dev team.
                In addition, I was collaborating with clinical specialists and KOLs both local and international,
                collecting their early
                feedback and other inputs. I also worked with the University in Zilina to incorporate ultrasound
                engineering as one of
                their study programs.</dd>

                imaging-centric features
                spread across multiple ultrasound medical systems in collaboration with development teams. I also made
                sure that various
                milestone specific deliveries are ready on time and in quality. This also required development and
                maintenance of
                various helper tools.</dd>

                ultrasound features.
                This involved creation, maintenance and extension of various state machines and other algorithms. As I
                gained
                experience, I contributed to architecture decisions, but later shifted towards a scrum master role.</dd>

      "\"The only game that is both thrilling and relaxing at the same time.\" Those would have been my thoughts on the game—if things hadn’t gone sideways.",
      " Unfortunately, they did, and I’m quite disappointed. Here’s the full story:<br/>",
      "I pre-ordered Art of Rally on iOS the second I learned it was coming, because I absolutely love its soundtrack. I listen to it a lot, mostly while driving my car.",
      " It’s my go-to album when I’m not in the mood for anything else. Once the game was released, I started playing through the career mode.",
      " I knew it would take quite some time to finish, but I was in no rush. As new games were released, I played Art of Rally less, but I always came back to it.",
      " As mentioned in my one-liner, the game had an almost meditative effect on me. It even helped me face some of my demons—which is a lot to say about a video game.<br/>",
      "After almost 18 months, the long-awaited moment finally came: earning one of my most precious Game Center achievements—Master of Rally. But I never got it, due to a bug.",
      " I immediately contacted the devs through various channels, but they ignored me at first.",
      " When I finally heard back, they explained that only one person was handling customer support and that it would take time to get to my ticket. It’s been three months since then...<br/>",
      "So yes, I finished Art of Rally, but it’s not officially on my list because I’ve been waiting for a fix or at least some guidance, but I ultimately ran out of patience.",
      " The worrying part isn’t just the bug—it’s that a company currently porting games to mobile has such poor support.",
      " This experience has completely destroyed my trust in Noodlecake, and I’m certain I won’t be pre-ordering or paying full price for any of their future releases."

      " I participated in the beta testing and immediately knew it was going to be a great one. After the official release, I was sure of it.",
      " The game has excellent physics, precise aiming, and pocketing balls just feels right.",
      " I really enjoy progressing through the various leagues, but when I don’t have much time, I just play the daily break.<br/>",
      "The folks at Shallot Games were kind enough to send me a promo code to remove the ads (so technically, I didn’t break my \"personal codex\").",
      " As far as I know, there’s no way to actually \"finish”\" the game, so I decided to write this blog post as a token of gratitude.<br/>",
      "If you enjoy pool billiards-inspired games, you can’t go wrong with this one. And if you don’t believe me, you can always try it for yourself."

      " Unfortunately, they did, and I’m quite disappointed. Here’s the full story:<br/>",
      "I pre-ordered Art of Rally on iOS the second I learned it was coming, because I absolutely love its soundtrack. I listen to it a lot, mostly while driving my car.",
      " It’s my go-to album when I’m not in the mood for anything else. Once the game was released, I started playing through the career mode.",
      " I knew it would take quite some time to finish, but I was in no rush. As new games were released, I played Art of Rally less, but I always came back to it.",
      " As mentioned in my one-liner, the game had an almost meditative effect on me. It even helped me face some of my demons—which is a lot to say about a video game.<br/>",
      "After almost 18 months, the long-awaited moment finally came: earning one of my most precious Game Center achievements—Master of Rally. But I never got it, due to a bug.",
      " I immediately contacted the devs through various channels, but they ignored me at first.",
      " When I finally heard back, they explained that only one person was handling customer support and that it would take time to get to my ticket. It’s been three months since then...<br/>",
      "So yes, I finished Art of Rally, but it’s not officially on my list because I’ve been waiting for a fix or at least some guidance, but I ultimately ran out of patience.",
      " The worrying part isn’t just the bug—it’s that a company currently porting games to mobile has such poor support.",
      " This experience has completely destroyed my trust in Noodlecake, and I’m certain I won’t be pre-ordering or paying full price for any of their future releases."

        <h3>Profile</h3>
        <p>
            I’m a software developer, systems engineer, and agile methodologies enthusiast with more than 18 years of
            project experience in developing software for medical devices. Throughout the years, I worked on multiple
            projects within the medical ultrasound domain. My preferred programming languages are C# and C++, though I
            have extensive experience with the former.<br>
            As my career progressed, my focus shifted from coding to having greater responsibility as a team's scrum
            master, followed by a role as a product owner. This role was later complemented by people management duties.
            After a few years, I took a break from leadership roles to gain substantial experience in systems
            engineering. My most recent role was a combination of team leader, product owner, and clinical collaboration
            representative.<br>
            I spent my entire career in a highly agile-focused environment which transformed from pure Scrum, to
            incorporating KANBAN and eventually SAFe.<br>
            I view myself as a person with robust leadership and organizational skills. I have strong analytical and
            problem-solving abilities and am always seeking new knowledge. Effective communication and interpersonal
            skills, alongside working both independently and collaboratively, are my key strengths.<br>
            Outside of work, I'm passionate about my family (married with two sons), sports (basketball, badminton, and
            mountain biking), video games (playing, designing, and creating), and reading.

            <dd>Responsibilities: I led and coordinated three international development teams - one software team, one
                team focusing on low level rendering improvements and a team of ultrasound engineers. As their product
                owner, my primary responsibility was gathering and analyzing requirements from diverse stakeholders,
                prioritizing team backlogs and planning accordingly. With my software development background, I
                supported the software development team. Furthermore, I collaborated with both local and international
                clinical specialists and Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs), collecting their early feedback and additional
                inputs. Additionally, I also collaborated with the University in Zilina to integrate ultrasound
                engineering into as of its study programs.</dd>
